# URLshortener

Step 5: Implement the URL Shortener
Now, start coding the service in Go. Break the implementation into phases to make it manageable.

5.1 Phase 1: Setup and Basic API
Setup: Initialize a Go project (go mod init urlshortener).
Dependencies: Add gin, sqlx, and validator using go get.
Basic Server: Create a simple HTTP server with gin that responds to POST /shorten.
Database: Set up SQLite with a basic schema for URLs.
Short Code Generation: Implement a simple random string generator (e.g., 6-character base62).
Validation: Validate URLs using the net/url package and validator.
5.2 Phase 2: Complete API Endpoints
Implement all endpoints (POST /shorten, GET /shorten/{shortCode}, etc.).
Add error handling for invalid URLs, non-existent short codes, etc.
Write unit tests for each endpoint using the testing package.
5.3 Phase 3: Add Caching
Integrate Redis for caching short URL mappings.
Cache GET /shorten/{shortCode} responses to reduce database load.
Update access_count in Redis and periodically sync to the database.
5.4 Phase 4: Add Frontend and Redirects
Create a simple HTML page with a form to shorten URLs.
Implement the GET /{shortCode} endpoint for redirects.
Test the redirect flow in a browser.
5.5 Phase 5: Add Advanced Features
Rate Limiting: Use golang.org/x/time/rate to limit API requests per user.
Logging: Add structured logging with logrus to track API usage.
Monitoring: Use a tool like Prometheus to monitor API performance (optional).
Security: Validate URLs to prevent XSS or malicious redirects.
5.6 Resources
GitHub Repos: Search for “Go URL shortener” on GitHub for example implementations.
Tutorials: Follow tutorials like “Building a URL Shortener in Go” on Medium or Dev.to.
Step 6: Test and Optimize
Unit Tests: Write tests for short code generation, URL validation, and API endpoints.
Integration Tests: Test the full flow (shorten → redirect → stats).
Performance Testing: Use tools like wrk or ab to simulate high traffic.
Optimization: Profile the application using pprof to identify bottlenecks.
Learning Goal: Learn about testing strategies and performance optimization in Go.
Step 7: Deploy and Scale
Deployment: Deploy the service to a platform like Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean.
Containerization: Use Docker to containerize the application.
Scaling: Set up a load balancer (e.g., Nginx) and multiple API instances.
Database Scaling: Explore sharding or replication for the database.
Learning Goal: Learn about DevOps, Docker, and cloud deployment.
Step 8: Advanced System Design Learning
To deepen your system design knowledge, explore these advanced topics:

Distributed Systems: Learn about distributed databases (e.g., DynamoDB) for scalability.
Consistent Hashing: Use for sharding short codes across multiple servers.
Bloom Filters: Optimize collision checks for short codes.
Analytics: Implement advanced analytics (e.g., access by region, device) using a time-series database like InfluxDB.
Resources: Read “System Design Primer” on GitHub or watch system design videos on YouTube.
Step 9: Iterate and Expand
Add Authentication: Allow users to create accounts and manage their URLs.
Custom Short Codes: Let users specify custom short codes.
Expiration: Add an expiration date for short URLs.
Analytics Dashboard: Build a dashboard to visualize URL statistics (e.g., using a chart library).
Learning Goal: Learn about feature development and iterative design.
